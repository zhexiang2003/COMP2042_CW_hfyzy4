The IDE I used for this assignment is IntelliJ. The reason why I used Intellij because of last semester's project, I completed last semester's project using Intellij. Therefore, I'm more familiar with the IntelliJ than Eclipse. Another reason I chose Intellij, because it is more user-friendly than Eclipse, and I do not have to spend time on learning how to use Eclipse. It is easier for me to set up Javafx and integrate Github in IntelliJ.

The javadocs is stored in C:\Users\zhexi\OneDrive - University of Nottingham Malaysia\University Projects\COMP2042_CW_hfyzy4\src\main\java\com\example\demo.

- Color picker
There are three colour buttons on the main menu which are Veri Peri, Dewberry and Ultimate Gray. Initially, I picked the concept of Red Green Blue(RGB), but I ditched the idea after the implementation. This is because the colour turns out to be ugly, especially green. Therefore, I got the idea of choosing the colours from Pantone, because the company recently announced their Colour of The Year. All of the colours are chosen as the colour of the year, except Dewberry.

- Background music at the end of the scene
There will be background music as the player entered the game over scene. I picked one of the most popular music which is "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley. The reason why I picked this music is because it is a popular meme known as 'Rickrolling'. Here's a basic information about 'Rickrolling'. This is an internet meme, which is pranking someone else by playing the music video of the song unexpectedly.

- Leaderboard
I created the FXML file for the leaderboard and a leaderboard button has been created in the main menu which the user can look at the leaderboard with one click. However, the leaderboard still remains empty and lines of error codes appeared in the IDE. The problem of the broken leaderboard system is that it copies the latest write entry and replaces all of the previous entry. Therefore, when the leaderboard button is pressed, it will display a list duplicated username and score. The length of the list depends on how many previous entries in the txt file.

Level system
I planned to create a level system, which the player is allowed to proceed to next level if they won. The reason why this is not implemeted because I spent too much time on the leaderboard.

The correct colour picker.
The alternative way is using the correct colour picker where it allows player/user to pick a colour from a wide variety of choice. Again, due to time contraints, I had to focus on creating other features. 

The new class I introduced:
- leaderboardController.java

The classes I had modified:
- Main.java
- Controller.java
- Endgame.java
- GameScene.java
- Account.java

Additional notes:

1. The background music is working properly but Microsoft Teams did not record the sound.
